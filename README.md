# DROWSINESS-DETECTION-ALERT-SYSTEM
I have created Drowsiness detection and Alert system in which first I detect the face landmarks with help of Mediapipe face mesh. Then I apply a logic for drowsiness detection that distance between mouth marks as well as both eye landmarks is less than threshold ratio then it will show alert on the screen and buzzer sound will turned on.

Python packages required:     


cvzone 1.5.6    
OpenCV 4.5.3     
Mediapipe 0.8.9.1     
pyglet 1.5.23
